# DogDash_2D_IOS_Game

2D IOS Mobile Game developed using Swift and SpriteKit for the Xcode IDE.

## Technologies

The main language used is Swift, along with the imported libraries of Swift UI and SpriteKit to provide the overall GUI of the app, as well as rendering the game scene.

``` Swift
import SwiftUI
import Spritekit
```
Furthermore, this project was built using the Xcode IDE and will only run on it. This is particularly due to XCode's nature in building suitable IOS mobile apps that allow for previews of the IOS device screen and being compatible with Apple's own software architecture.

## Installation & Setup

Installation will require the download of Xcode on a Mac (A Windows machine may be able to do this via a Virtual Machine if you have no other options).

Once installed, open up XCode and simply import the project folder (DogDash). Then, simply press the play button on the top left of the XCode screen to build the app and attach it to the simulator. Note: the project was simulated on an iPhone 13, so it would be preferable to run it on such a model, as it may not be suited to other devices.

## Features & Screenshots




## Project Status

Complete, however, there is room for improvement in adjusting the GUI or enhancing current features.
